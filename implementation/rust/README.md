# SUTP-rust

A demo (library) implementation to show how segment parsing would be done in Rustlang.

## Compiling

If you haven't done so already, install the rust language compiler via https://rustup.rs/ (or via Homebrew or via your favourite package manager of choice). Run `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` in this directory to compile the programs. The binaries can be found in `target/{debug,release}`.
