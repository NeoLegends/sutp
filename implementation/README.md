# SUTP-rust

A demo (library) implementation to show how segment parsing would be done in Rustlang.

## Compiling

If you haven't done so already, install the rust language compiler via https://rustup.rs/ (or via Homebrew or via your favourite package manager of choice). Run `cargo build` or `cargo build --release` in this directory to compile the programs. The binaries can be found in `target/{debug,release}`.

This project is built against the latest stable version of rust (1.30 at the time of writing). Your mileage may vary with older compilers. Updating the rust compiler, however, is very easy with rustup.
